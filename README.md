**Simple "game" built with pixi.js**

The original plan was to build a simple game where you control an agile character (e.g. he can dodge, walljump, doublejump etc.) within a constrained space where you have to dodge stuff (e.g. falling rocks, trapdoors, bullets being fired at you).

However, the project stopped after the main movement implementation, so currently it is not really a "game", as there is no objective / scoring functionality.

Feel free to walljump and dodge around here though: [https://verfehlix.github.io/doj/](https://verfehlix.github.io/doj/)
